# MAL-Scrubber(s)
A Selenium webdriver x python script tool for easy scrubbing of myanimelist.net forum posts and another for anime / manga list entries.

1) Download and install Selenium webdriver -> Chromedriver
2) Download and install Python.
3) Setup proper python environment.
4) Download Notepad++ 
5) Open the file with Np++ and edit your login credentials into the proper fields (indicated inside the file).
6) Enter the link to your forum post history (also indicated + there's an example to make sure you see where it is and know what is required).
7) Read all the notes inside the file. It's the text that comes after a #. They're green in a proper code editor or Np++
8) Save the changes, exit the file, double click on it (or run after dragging into cmd if you're an oldfriend).

9) Sit back and enjoy watching a retro-chronological slideshow of your forum posts... being deleted :>

OR

9) Sit back and watch all you list entries disappear one by one.

Note: The steps above take 15 minutes, in the worst case, just look it up in YT if you need help with the webdriver and python enviroment.
There are simple 2-4 minute videos for each of the 1st 3 steps and that is with(!) the explanation. 
Repeating what they show there takes even less time.
